    "summary": "### Overall Mood\nThe user initially reported feeling good and positive but later expressed a range of emotions including anxiety, joy, anger, and upset. The overall mood appears to be variable and reactive to the conversation.\n\n### Sleep\nNo information provided.\n\n### Appetite\nNo information provided.\n\n### Main Stressors\nThe specific main stressors are not clearly identified, but the user seems to be dealing with some underlying issues that are causing anxiety, anger, and upset. These stressors may be related to personal or emotional challenges.\n\n### Protective Factors / Supports\nThe user mentioned going for a walk as a coping strategy, which suggests that they are using physical activity to manage their emotions. The assistant also suggested reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support, implying that the user has some social support available.\n\n### Risk Level\nMedium. The user's emotions appear to be quite labile, shifting between positive and negative states. While there are no explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts or severe hopelessness, the user's abrupt ending of the session and expression of strong negative emotions (upset, disgust, anger) suggest that they may be struggling with some significant emotional challenges. However, the user's use of healthy coping strategies (going for a walk) and the assistant's supportive responses help mitigate the risk level.",
