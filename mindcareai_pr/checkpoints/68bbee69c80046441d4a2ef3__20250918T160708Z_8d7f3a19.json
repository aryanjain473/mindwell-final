    "summary": "### Overall Mood\nThe user, Aryan, initially presented with feelings of frustration, upset, and self-criticism. Throughout the session, there was a noticeable shift towards feeling more confident and joyful, but residual unease and self-doubt were still present at the end of the session.\n\n### BOLD(Sleep)\nNo information provided.\n\n### Appetite\nNo information provided.\n\n### Main Stressors\n- Aryan expressed feeling \"less good\" and frustration with themselves.\n- Struggling with self-criticism, disappointment, self-doubt, and regret.\n\n### Protective Factors / Supports\n- The user was open to taking deep breaths and practicing self-compassion.\n- The support session itself provided a space for Aryan to express feelings and receive understanding.\n\n### Risk Level\nMedium. Aryan experienced significant distress related to self-criticism and negative self-view. Although there was a positive emotional shift during the session, the presence of residual self-doubt and unease suggests ongoing vulnerability. No explicit mention of severe suicidal ideation or intent was made, but the level of distress and self-criticism warrants a medium risk level.",
